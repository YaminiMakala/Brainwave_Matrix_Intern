Harnessing the power of data to drive sales forecasting and insights! Explore this project where we analyze historical sales data and predict future trends using advanced time-series forecasting techniques.

This project focuses on analyzing sales data from a global superstore over four years to identify trends, make forecasts, and provide actionable insights. The tasks performed include Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), forecasting sales for the upcoming days, and presenting recommendations to improve business strategies.

Key Components:
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

Handled missing values, outliers, and formatting issues to prepare the dataset for analysis.
Extracted useful features from the "Order Date" such as year, month, day, and weekday to enhance the model's performance.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized key trends in sales and profit.
Identified top-selling products, categories, and regions contributing to overall performance.
Analyzed relationships between sales and profit to uncover patterns.
Sales Forecasting using Facebook Prophet:

Built and trained a time-series forecasting model using Prophet to predict sales for the next seven days.
Evaluated model accuracy by comparing predicted values (yhat) with actual sales (y).
Insights and Recommendations:

Sales trends and key performance indicators were highlighted.
Best-selling products and their contributions to total sales were analyzed.
Suggested strategies to boost performance in underperforming categories and regions.
Results:
Achieved a precise understanding of sales trends and identified opportunities for optimization.
Forecasted sales with Prophet, yielding insights that could guide future business strategies.
Technologies Used:
Python: For data manipulation and model building.
Pandas: For data cleaning and preprocessing.
Seaborn & Matplotlib: For visualizing the sales and profit trends.
Prophet: For time-series forecasting.
Jupyter Notebook: For writing and presenting the analysis.
